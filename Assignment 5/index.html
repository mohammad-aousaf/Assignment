    <p>US financial regulators have charged failed South Korean cryptocurrency boss Do Kwon and his company Terrraform
        Labs with “orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud”.
        The Singapore-based firm created the Terra Luna and TerraUSD tokens, which collapsed spectacularly last year.Mr
        Kwon and Terraform Labs did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.“We allege that Terraform and
        Do Kwon failed to provide the public with full, fair, and truthful disclosure as required for a host of crypto
        asset securities, most notably for LUNA and Terra USD,” US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman
        Gary Gensler said in a statement.
        “We also allege that they committed fraud by repeating false and misleading statements to build trust before
        causing devastating losses for investors,” he added.
        According to the SEC, Mr Kwon and his company raised billions of dollars from investors by selling them “an
        interconnected suite of crypto asset securities” with many transactions being unregistered.
        The SEC also alleged Mr Kwon and Terraform claimed repeatedly that the tokens would increase in value, and
        misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD.
        However, the value of the token and its linked Luna cryptocurrency plunged to close to zero in May last year.
        Globally, investors in TerraUSD and Luna lost an estimated $42bn, according to blockchain analytics firm
        Elliptic.
        It triggered a sell-off in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether. As a result the term
        cryptocrash trended online.
        “I am heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you,” Mr Kwon said at the time.
        The SEC complaint, which included other allegations, did not state where Mr Kwon was located. In December, South
        Korean authorities, who have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Kwon, said they believed he was in Serbia.
        Mr Kwon had previously denied that he was in hiding, but did not reveal his whereabouts.

                    Solana, a poster coin of the crypto future, is in trouble. The cryptocurrency, which had been lauded by
                    FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried, has been hit harder than any other major coin by the collapse of the
                    exchange.
                    The Solana token, or SOL, has dropped 53.8% since the furor began unfolding on 2 November. By
                    comparison, ether has fallen about 20% and bitcoin 19%.
                    “In the current crypto shakeout, the most unfortunate innocent victim is the Solana ecosystem,” said
                    Stefan Rust, CEO of blockchain wallet company Laguna Labs. He and several other crypto players said FTX
                    and sister firm Alameda Research likely sold a large amount of the coin in an attempt to stay afloat.
                    Many investors and app developers look to be leaving the Solana blockchain, which is widely used for
                    decentralised finance applications; the number of SOL coins deposited there has fallen to 24.74 million,
                    some way south of the 68.2 million seen in June, according to data from aggregator DeFiLlama.
                    FTX and Alameda Research didn’t respond to requests for comment. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko
                    tweeted that development company Solana Labs didn’t hold any assets on FTX and had enough financial
                    runway for around 30 months. Another co-founder, Raj Gokal, said this was a “crucible” moment for the
                    ecosystem, adding “each time, we’re stronger”.

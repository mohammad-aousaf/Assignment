        The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic
        sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are
        believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.
        The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the ancient Greeks, and may have been the site of
        Barbarikon, an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the Indus River.[57][58][59][60] Karachi
        may also have been referred to as Ramya in ancient Greek texts.[61]
        The ancient site of Krokola, a natural harbor west of the Indus where Alexander the Great sailed his fleet for
        Achaemenid Assyria, may have been located near the mouth of Karachi's Malir River,[62][63][64] though some
        believe it was located near Gizri.[65][66] No other natural harbor exists near the mouth of the Indus that could
        accommodate a large fleet.[67] Nearchus, who commanded Alexander's naval fleet, also mentioned a hilly island by
        the name of Morontobara and an adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as
        Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions.[68][69][70] Both
        areas were island until well into the colonial era, when silting in led to them being connected to the
        mainland.[71]In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from
        where he launched his forces further into the Indus Valley in 712.[72] Some have identified the port with
        Karachi, though some argue the location was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta.[73][74]
        Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus River
        Delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese
        incursions into Sindh. In 1553–54, Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis, mentioned a small port along the Sindh coast
        by the name of Kaurashi which may have been Karachi.[75][76][77] The Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi's modern
        suburbs were built around this time between the 15th and 18th centuries.
        Kolachi settlement
        The Manora Fort, built-in 1797 to defend Karachi, was captured by the British on 3 February 1839 and upgraded
        1888–1889.
        19th century Karachi historian Seth Naomal Hotchand recorded that a small settlement of 20–25 huts existed along
        the Karachi Harbour that was known as Dibro, which was situated along a pool of water known as
        Kolachi-jo-Kun.[78] In 1725, a band of Baloch settlers from Makran and Kalat had settled in the hamlet after
        fleeing droughts and tribal feuds.[79]A new settlement was built in 1729 at the site of Dibro, which came to be
        known as Kolachi-jo-Goth ("The village of Kolachi").[29] The new settlement is said to have been named in honour
        of Mai Kolachi, a resident of the old settlement whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile.[29]
        Kolachi was about 40 hectares in size, with some smaller fishing villages scattered in its vicinity.[80] The
        founders of the new fortified settlement were Sindhi Baniyas,[79] and are said to have arrived from the nearby
        town of Kharak Bandar after the harbour there silted in 1728 after heavy rains.[81] Kolachi was fortified, and
        defended with cannons imported from Muscat, Oman. Under the Talpurs, the Rah-i-Bandar road was built to connect
        the city's port to the caravan terminals.[82] This road would eventually be further developed by the British
        into Bandar Road, which was renamed Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road.[83][84]
        The name Karachee was used for the first time in a Dutch document from 1742, in which a merchant ship de
        Ridderkerk is shipwrecked near the settlement.[55][56] In 1770s, Karachi came under the control of the Khan of
        Kalat, which attracted a second wave of Balochi settlers.[79] In 1795, Karachi was annexed by the Talpurs,
        triggering a third wave of Balochi settlers who arrived from central Sindh and southern Punjab.[79] The Talpurs
        built the Manora Fort in 1797,[85][86] which was used to protect Karachi's Harbor from al-Qasimi pirates.[87]
        In 1799 or 1800, the founder of the Talpur dynasty, Mir Fateh Ali Khan, allowed the East India Company under
        Nathan Crow to establish a trading post in Karachi.[88] He was allowed to build a house for himself in Karachi
        at that time, but by 1802 was ordered to leave the city.[89] The city continued to be ruled by the Talpurs until
        it was occupied by forces under the command of John Keane in February 1839.[90]
        British control
        An 1897 image of Karachi's Rampart Row street in Mithadar
        Some of Karachi's most recognized structures, such as Frere Hall, date from the British Raj.
        Karachi features several examples of colonial-era Indo-Saracenic architecture, such as the KMC Building.The
        British East India Company captured Karachi on 3 February 1839 after HMS Wellesley opened fire and quickly
        destroyed Manora Fort, which guarded Karachi Harbour at Manora Point.[91] Karachi's population at the time was
        an estimated 8,000 to 14,000,[92] and was confined to the walled city in Mithadar, with suburbs in what is now
        the Serai Quarter.[93] British troops, known as the "Company Bahadur" established a camp to the east of the
        captured city, which became the precursor to the modern Karachi Cantonment. The British further developed the
        Karachi Cantonment as a military garrison to aid the British war effort in the First Anglo-Afghan War.[94]
        Portuguese Goan community started migrating to Karachi in the 1820s as traders. The majority of the estimated
        100,000 who came to Pakistan are primarily concentrated in Karachi.[95]
        Sindh's capital was shifted from Hyderabad to Karachi in 1840 when Karachi was annexed to the British Empire
        after Major General Charles James Napier captured the rest of Sindh following his victory against the Talpurs at
        the Battle of Miani. Following the 1843 annexation, on 17 February the entire province was amalgamated into the
        Bombay Presidency for the next 93 years, and Karachi remain the divisional headquarter. A few years later in
